# Pong Game Code Explanation

This document provides an explanation of the Pong game code implemented in Java. The code creates a simple Pong game where two players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The code is designed to be easy to understand, especially for beginners starting in Java.

## Class Structure

The Pong game code is structured as follows:

- The `PongGame` class extends the `Frame` class and implements game logic, handles key inputs, and controls the rendering of graphics.

## Game Initialization

- The `PongGame` constructor sets up the game window with a title, size, and visibility.
- It creates an off-screen buffer called `tripleBuffer` using the `createImage()` method.
- The initial positions and speeds of the ball and paddles are initialized.
- Key and window listeners are added to handle input and window closing events.

## Game Loop

- The game loop runs continuously in a separate thread, updating the game state and rendering the graphics.
- Inside the loop, the `moveBall()` method updates the ball's position based on its current speed and handles scoring logic.
- The `repaint()` method is called to redraw the graphics on the window.

## Drawing Graphics

- The `paint()` method is overridden to draw the graphics on the off-screen buffer (`tripleBuffer`).
- The buffer is cleared with a black background using `fillRect()`.
- The paddles and ball are drawn using `fillRect()` and `fillOval()` methods, respectively.
- The scores of each player are displayed using `drawString()`.
- Finally, the buffer is copied to the screen using `drawImage()`.

## Input Handling

- The `handleKeyPress()` method handles the key presses for moving the paddles.
- It updates the position of the paddles based on the key inputs.

## Ball Movement and Scoring

- The `moveBall()` method updates the ball's position based on its speed.
- If the ball goes off the left side, `score2` (player 2) is incremented, and the ball is reset.
- If the ball goes off the right side, `score1` (player 1) is incremented, and the ball is reset.
- Collision detection is performed to check if the ball hits the paddles, and the ball's speed is reversed accordingly.
- If the ball hits the top or bottom walls, its vertical speed is reversed.

## Ball Reset

- The `resetBall()` method resets the ball's position to the center of the window.
- It also randomly determines the new direction of the ball by setting the `ballSpeedX` and `ballSpeedY` variables.
